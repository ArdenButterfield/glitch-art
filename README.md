Glitch art examines the aesthetics of corrupting, distorting, and mangling images, filling them with noise until you can't look away. This report is the story of my journey through glitch art, over the past couple months. In chapter 1, I look the interactions between the humans and technology that go into the creation of images. I discuss sevral visual ethics concerns, and how glitch art can be solution. In chapter 2, I reflect on ways that artists, including myself, have found meaning through glitch art. I document my own process of writing and using code to create glitch art, describing the technical goals and solutions of the project in chapter 3. Finally, chapter 4 is a gallery of glitch art that I created using my code.
