    "# Chapter 0: A True Glitch\n",

    "![A true glitch](img/trueglitch.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This was one of the first images I created in this project. I had just started writing code that would eventually grow into a sprawling set of methods to warp images in every way I could think of. I was writing the initial code for reading and writing image files using the Python Image Library, and I tested what I had written using a simple image: half black and half white, split diagonally down the middle. I expected the result to be identical, just with a different filemane. The image I encounted was a glitch. (The image above is zoomed in, to show the individual pixel structure)\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the first glitch I encountered, in this quest to find glitches. It was also the *truest* glitch I made throughout the entire process. I didn't expect a glitch at all, and I don't totally understand the image I got.\n",
    "\n",
    "This glitch reveals something about the tools I was using. It shows that this software sees colors in red, green, and blue, and that a four by four grid is in some way related to how the software interprets an image. When I went back to the test image, after fixing the problem with my code, I saw that simple image in a new, deeper light. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even in this simple task of reading and writing an image, there was a potential for undefined behavior. There can be code that is not correct, but not *so* incorrect that it crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've spent the last two months creating and exploring these liminal spaces of correct mistakes. Let me give you a tour."
