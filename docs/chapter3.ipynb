    "Cellular automata can be seen as a kind of game, with pixels as players. Each pixel can be in one of two states: either on or off. Every round of the game, the pixels check their state, and the states of their neighbors. They look that information up in a specific table (this table is the \"rule\" of that particular game), and turn on or off accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are one- and two-dimensional versions of this game. A famous two-dimensional rule is known as Conway's Game of Life. Despite it's simplicity, it is possible, though very difficult, to build complex structures within the game. \"Although each cell has an extremely limited view of the system (just its immediate neighbours), localised information is propagated at each time step, enabling more global characteristics of the overall CA system\" [(Rosin, \"Image Processing\", 790)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cviu.2010.02.005). For instance, in 2018, a group successfully built a working game of Tetris within Conway's Game of Life itself.

    "Since this is the technical chapter, I suppose I need to give a bit of background into how I created these images. Essentially, I layered each generation over a new line of pixels in the image. When a pixel was \"on,\" I inverted the colors of the image— so that white would become black, magenta would become green, and so forth. You can see that in the example above: the inversion of light blue/gray (the initial color) is dark orange/brown. However, as with any game, it isn't enough to have rules for how to make a move: you also need rules for how to set up the game to get ready to play. I decided to start with all pixels in the off state (where the color is not modified), but if a pixel is light enough, it flips to the on state (where the color will be inverted), at which point it will influence future pixels according to the rulebook.\n",

Glitch art is about exploration, and about producing unexpected results from computer algorithms. From the simple rules of cellular automata, I always discover new and surpirisingly complex things. The collaborative nature of cellular automata— with each \"player\" following simple rules, but producing something larger and unexpected— also speaks to my philosophies about the human-computer interactions in glitch art.\n",

Peña et al. define data bending as \"using software with the intention of disrupting a file at the raw data level.\" [(90)](https://go.gale.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA497861449) For instance, one can open images in a text editor, manipulate them as text, and then open them as an image once again. Data bending was a really fun part of this project, and it produced some interesting results. Because of the complexity of image encodings, it was also one of the most unpredictable parts of this project.\n",

I found that some images would not display in the Preview app (the default image viewer on Apple computers), but would display when opened in Google Chrome. This was especially the case with BMP image files, since that format is primarily supported on Microsoft Windows computers. Some changes rendered files unreadable in any program.\n",

This part of the program is still buggy, and I find it generally easier to data bend images manually, by opening the image as text, or in a hexidecimal reader. (I used Vim for reading and editing the hexidecimal, which I did when I wanted to change parts of the image header, which required more precision than I could easily get from text editors. The command `:%!xxd` will convert the image to hexidecimal. Then you can make changes, and save them to another file with the command `:%!xxd -r >outfile`. This makes it really easy to try things out, and get quick results.)"

JPEG images are much more compressed than BMP images: an image saved as a JPEG can be 20 times smaller than the same image stored as a BMP [(Miano, 35)](http://index-of.co.uk/Information-Theory/Compressed%20Image%20File%20Formats%20JPEG,%20PNG,%20GIF,%20XBM,%20BMP%20-%20John%20Miano.pdf). JPEG images are created by breaking the image into 8x8 pixel blocks, and processing these blocks individually, using a sum of cosine functions to approximate the block (Ibid. 44). This is why data bending JPEG images produces glitches as a grid of brightly colored blocks. Because of the complicated compression algorithms, I liked JPEG data bending more than BMP data bending: I couldn't exactly predict, or even explain, the results, so the process involved more experimentation."

Once again, we find that complex and unexpected patterns emerge from these simple rules. For this algorithm, we create a matrix of numbers, and tile that matrix across the image. When the value of a pixel is greater than the value of the matrix element tiled to that pixel, we light it up, otherwise, it stays dark.\n",

    "To make that happen, it was important to have a way to undo actions. I implemented undoing by storing a list of copied Glitcher objects— essentially just shells around the corresponding ImageStorage representation. To set a checkpoint, the code just makes a new copy and pushes it on the end of the list. To undo to the most recent checkpoint, it pops the last element off the list, and sets that objects image as the current image.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier to go revert to an earlier chackpoint, I gave the user the option of naming their checkpoints. The names are stored in the list, alongside the copy of the Glitcher object. When the user reverts to a named checkpoint, the code searches through the list for that name, discards all checkpoints after the name, and sets that checkpoint image as the current image.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a method for making a copy of a Glitcher object. As it stands, the copy does not have the checkpoints of the original, although I may implement that in the future."
