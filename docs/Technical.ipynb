    "One of the first questions I considered was how to store the images within the glitcher object. There was no singular format that would work for everything I wanted to be able to do to the images. \n",
    "- For some methods, such as shuffling the bytes of the image file, the image needed to be encoded in a format such as JPEG. \n",
    "- For other methods, such as changing the contrast, I wanted to take advantage of the Python Image Library (PIL), which required the image representation to be stored as a PIL Image object. \n",
    "- For the bulk of my methods, I wanted to be able to interact with the pixels of the image as plainly as possible, which meant storing it as a three dimensional Numpy array: two dimensions for the width and height, and the third dimension for the RGB values of each pixel. Since I was writing this in Python, it was important to use a package such as Numpy, since for most actions, manipulating arrays in Numpy is significantly faster than manipulating them item by item as Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle these various storage methods, and the conversion between them, I created a new class, called ImageStorage, that would handle all the conversion. When the Glitcher needed the image to be in that format, it would call call the ImageStorage method to fetch the image in that format. If the image was already in that format, the ImageStorage object would just return that image. Otherwise, it would conver to the needed format.\n",
    "\n",
    "But between Numpy arrays, PIL Images, and bytes for JPEG, PNG, and BMP image encodings, we now have $5$ formats, and we need to be able to convert from any one of these methods to any other one. If we need a separate function to convert from each method to each other method, we're looking at an unwieldy amount of code. Additionally, if we add a new format— say, we want to be able to work with GIF encoded images— we don't want to have to write separate methods to convert from that format to every other format.\n",

PIL is built to be able to read and write image files, so we can modify that easily to allow it to read and write to byte objects instead. Now, when converting between two representations, we just convert to a PIL image, and then to the other format."

    "To make that happen, it was important to have a way to undo actions. I implemented this as a list of copied Glitcher objects— essentially just a shell around the corresponding ImageStorage representaiton. To set a checkpoint, the code just makes a new copy and pushes it on the end of the list. To undo to the most recent checkpoint, it pops the last element off the list, and sets that objects image as the current image.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier to go back a large number of checkpoints, I give the user an option of giving checkpoints a name, which is stored alongside the copy in the list. When the user reverts to a named checkpoint, the code searches through the list for that name, discards all checkpoints after the name, and sets that checkpoint image as the current image.\n",

Glitch art is about exploration, and about producing unexpected results from computer algorithms. From the simple rules of  As much as I've studied cellular automata, I always discover new things.

When a pixel was \"on,\" I inverted the colors of the image— so that white would become black, magenta would become green, and so forth. You can see that in the example above: the inversion of light blue/gray (the initial color) is dark orange/brown. However, as with any game, it isn't enough to have rules for how to play: you also need rules for how to set up the game to get ready to play. I decided to start with all pixels in the off state (so there are no changes to the color), but if a pixel is light enough, it flips to the on state (where the color will be inverted), at which point it will influence future pixels as the rules dictate.\n",
