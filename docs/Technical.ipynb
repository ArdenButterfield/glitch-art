    "- For some methods, such as shuffling the bytes of the image file, the image needed to be encoded in a format such as JPEG. \n",
    "- For other methods, such as changing the contrast, I wanted to take advantage of the Python Image Library (PIL), which required the image representation to be stored as a PIL Image object. \n",
    "- For the bulk of my methods, I wanted to be able to interact with the pixels of the image as plainly as possible, which meant storing it as a three dimensional Numpy array: two dimensions for the width and height, and the third dimension for the RGB values of each pixel. Since I was writing this in Python, it was important to use a package such as Numpy, since for most actions, manipulating arrays in Numpy is significantly faster than manipulating them item by item as Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle these various storage methods, and the conversion between them, I created a new class, called ImageStorage, that would handle all the conversion. When the Glitcher needed the image to be in that format, it would call call the ImageStorage method to fetch the image in that format. If the image was already in that format, the ImageStorage object would just return that image. Otherwise, it would conver to the needed format.\n",

(I used Vim for reading and editing the hexidecimal, which I did when I wanted to change parts of the image header, which required more precision than I could easily get from text editors. The command `:%!xxd` will convert the image to hexidecimal. Then you can make changes, and save them to another file with the command `:%!xxd -r >outfile`.
